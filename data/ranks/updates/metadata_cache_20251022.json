[War Frenzy] Mechanism Adjustments\n• Fleets that initiate attacks against other traders will enter the [War Frenzy] status, gaining increased Attack and applying a Slow effect to targets. Fleets in this status cannot teleport, be recalled, or be repaired. The duration resets if the status is triggered again.\n• Leaving a rally or garrison during War Frenzy will temporarily prevent you from rejoining.\n• Removed the special War Frenzy and Slow effect when flanked in the \"Disciple Hunting Grounds\" event. Future events will now uniformly apply the standard [War Frenzy] mechanics.\n\n2. Port Garrison Improvements\n• Garrisoned fleets now have a default Defense bonus.\n• When any fleet garrisoned at a Port triggers [War Frenzy], all fleets garrisoned at that Port will receive the [War Frenzy] bonus.\n\n3. New [Home Port Logistics] Feature\n• When not engaged in combat, fleets at your Home Port reduce Major Damage over time.\n\n4. Reporting System Launch\n• You can now report in-game violations such as inappropriate names, custom avatars, and chat content.\n\n5. Daily Quest Simplification\n• Reduced progress requirements, making rewards easier to obtain.\n\n6.

If your formation can easily defeat enemies in multiple upcoming stages, you can use this feature to complete several stages at once and receive the corresponding rewards.\n\n- Rosie’s exclusive showcase [Neon Stage] is now available in the shelter! Chiefs can unlock this decoration and watch Rosie’s stunning performance after purchasing the [1st Buy] bundle. Players who have already purchased the [1st Buy] bundle will automatically unlock [Neon Stage] after updating to the latest version and can manually place it.\n\n[Optimizations & Fixes]\n- Hero Signature Weapon Optimization:\n1.

After the update, the number of minefields per layer will dynamically adjust based on the current mining progress of that layer, allowing Chiefs to more quickly view and select target mines.\n\n- Adjusted the size of some decorative buildings to better display your collection. Due to these size changes, all decorations will temporarily revert to an unplaced state after the update (no effect on attribute bonuses). Chiefs can reposition them according to preference.\n\n- Chat Optimizations:\n1. Private chat limit increased to 100 users.\n2. Maximum chat message length increased to 1000 characters.\n3. Season chat channels will not close immediately after the season ends but will remain open until new season matchmaking is completed.\n\n- Optimized the custom avatar upload process in Chief info, adding a status display for “Avatar Under Review.”",
