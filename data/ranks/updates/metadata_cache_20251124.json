If your alliance has already registered before this update and needs to adjust, please make changes before server time Saturday 00:00.\n- Black Gold Battlefield originally had three time slots: 01:00, 10:00, and 19:00 (server time). Due to low participation and poor match balance, the 01:00 slot has been removed. Only the 10:00 and 19:00 sessions remain. This change takes effect next Monday.\n\n[Main Screen]\n- Streamlined the World main interface to expand combat operation space: Removed the left sidebar. Troop information is now permanently displayed in the lower right corner.\n- Two new settings added under [Avatar → Settings → General Settings]: [Drag Troop Avatars on the Main Screen to Control Troops] and [Return Button Visibility Next to Troop]. Used to enable/disable troop control via dragging avatars and toggling the visibility of the return button next to squads.\n- Scout troops now display both march and return time.\n- Increased spacing between the 4 march queues on the right side to reduce accidental taps.\n- Added a [Rally] button to the left of the right-side march queues for quick access to the rally interface.\n- The rally prompt bubble no longer pops up at the bottom left of the main screen when eligible for auto-join rallies.\n- Removed the [Capital] prompt bubble at the bottom left of the President/Vice President view.\n- Removed the quick-jump bubble on Saturdays during the Alliance Duel [Enemy Buster].\n- This is currently active in States 1-120, with others to follow.\n\n[Others]\n- After obtaining a new skin item, tapping [Unlock] will now directly navigate to the skin interface.",

          "releaseNotes": "NEW CHAMPIONS\n\n\nLizard:\nDr. Curtis Connors is a renowned scientist and field surgeon who tragically lost an arm during his service. After returning to civilian life, he devoted himself to finding a way to regenerate lost limbs by developing a serum based on reptilian DNA. He used himself as the first test subject, and while the serum worked, it also mutated his DNA and he turned himself into a human-reptile hybrid known as the Lizard. \n\n\nSpider-Man (Pavitr Prabhakar): \nPavitr Prabhakar was born and raised in the vibrant but gridlocked city of Mumbattan. Granted magical spider powers by a shaman and guided by the moral lessons of his Aunt Maya and late uncle Bhim, he has assumed the heroic mantle of Spider-Man. These model heroics led to his induction into the Spider-Society. When the Spot invades his city and causes a disaster, Pavitr gets a painful look at the darker sides of his new life, and now searches for a better way forward for the multiverse.\n\n\nCHAMPION UPDATES\n\n\nThor (Jane Foster): \nJane returns with a brand new look! Stacking Shocks on herself to strengthen her abilities throughout a fight.\nJane’s high amount of Buff and Power Control allows her to control the Tempo of many fights against Cosmic Champions.\n\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n\nBattlegrounds Unranked Queue\nStarting with Season 34, Battlegrounds will now have a permanent unranked queue type. This queue will be open to Proven and higher Summoners and will cost energy to enter. Matchups will be based on an individual Summoner’s roster strength. \nRanked matches will now exclusively cost Elders Marks to enter, which can be exchanged for energy in the newly-tuned Battlegrounds Store. Ranked matches will also now be accessible to Thronebreaker and higher Summoners.\n\n\nThe Cosmic Egg Relic \nSome cosmic force is drawing Unusual Eggs into The Battlerealm. And none are more unusual than the Cosmic Egg Relic. Its origins and abilities are currently a mystery. Become the envy of the coop and embark on an egg hunt like no other!\n\n\nNEW QUESTS AND EVENTS\n\n\nEvent Quest - So Much More\nPavitr Prabhakar is investigating strange multiversal tech and trespassers and looks to The Summoner to lend a hand. Meanwhile The Lizard has stumbled into The Battlerealm after years of trying to avoid this multiversal fate. It would seem that a Sinister Six (and then some) of villains is behind both arrivals but how will these Spider-friends and foes fend when the web is revealed.\n\n\nSide Quest - Top Of The Charts\nLumatrix is fascinated by the mortals, gods, mutants, and monsters which have infected The Battlerealm. Before The Founders arrive and wipe away existence, they are eager to see what kind of a spectacle they can put on! It seems that the pure thunder and blazes of battle are like music to Lumatrix’s ears. So they are demanding an epic “concert” to play out as Summoners challenge their teams to greater and greater heights!\n\n\nSide Quest - Deadpool’s Mini-Tour Maze\nDeadpool wants to invite each and every Summoner to take part in his new and fantastical Mini-Tour Maze filled with wonders and treasures beyond your belief. Each time you enter the Mini-Tour Maze will be a new exciting experience as you explore its winding paths. Tread lightly however as not even Deadpool knows what dangers may be lurking around each and every corner. You may even encounter the marvelous Deadpool himself wandering the labyrinth (definitely not because he’s lost).\n\n\nAlliance War Showcase: Fantastic Force\nThe Alliance War Showcase returns, featuring some familiar defenders and Alliance War tactics from the Fantastic Force Saga. The Class Quests also introduce a new fight component--Effect Areas--as the central mechanic for the ramping node!\n\n\nIncursions Saga Sector\nAnother Saga staple is returning, with the Founders’ War Saga Sector! Take your #Saga tagged Champions and fight through the zones to earn lucrative rewards.\n\n\nAll this and more! Check out the complete list of exciting updates on playcontestofchampions.com",

Survivors can now launch multiple rallies and send multiple reinforcement squads to both targets separately.\n- When launching a rally or sending reinforcements to the [Capital] or a [Turret], the troop capacity is additionally increased by 40,000.\n- After the [State of Supremacy] event ends, if there are untreated units in the State Hospital, a reminder bubble will appear at the bottom left of the main screen. Note: The State Hospital closes at server time Tuesday 00:00. Untreated units will be permanently lost!\n\n[Black Gold Battlefield]\n- Removed the sign-up session restriction for Team A and Team B. Both teams can now sign up for the same battle session. If your alliance has already registered before this update and needs to adjust, please make changes before server time Saturday 00:00.\n- Black Gold Battlefield originally had three time slots: 01:00, 10:00, and 19:00 (server time). Due to low participation and poor match balance, the 01:00 slot has been removed. Only the 10:00 and 19:00 sessions remain. This change takes effect next Monday.\n\n[Main Screen]\n- Streamlined the World main interface to expand combat operation space: Removed the left sidebar. Troop information is now permanently displayed in the lower right corner.\n- Two new settings added under [Avatar → Settings → General Settings]: [Drag Troop Avatars on the Main Screen to Control Troops] and [Return Button Visibility Next to Troop]. Used to enable/disable troop control via dragging avatars and toggling the visibility of the return button next to squads.\n- Scout troops now display both march and return time.\n- Increased spacing between the 4 march queues on the right side to reduce accidental taps.\n- Added a [Rally] button to the left of the right-side march queues for quick access to the rally interface.\n- The rally prompt bubble no longer pops up at the bottom left of the main screen when eligible for auto-join rallies.\n- Removed the [Capital] prompt bubble at the bottom left of the President/Vice President view.\n- Removed the quick-jump bubble on Saturdays during the Alliance Duel [Enemy Buster].\n- This is currently active in States 1-120, with others to follow.\n\n[Others]\n- After obtaining a new skin item, tapping [Unlock] will now directly navigate to the skin interface.",
