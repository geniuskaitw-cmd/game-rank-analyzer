Inhabiting a body composed of billions of tiny, synthetic ISO-based organisms, Imperiosa is able to rearrange these \"\"Synthects\"\" into a myriad of useful forms and functions depending on the situation. Additionally, Synthects can disassemble matter around them, providing raw materials to replicate themselves without limit. Though a hive mind, Imperiosa manifests as one voice speaking with absolute authority; an icon of the vile past, volatile present, and violent future of The Founders.\n\n\nCHAMPION UPDATES\n\n\nPunisher \nPunisher can handle some punishment before dishing it out. Indestructible and Physical Resistance are prominent once again.\nCritical Hits and Bleeding out his Opponent make their return.\nVillain's will fear his Impact, shredding their block with a Special 2 Attack.\n\nWolverine (X-23) \nLaura is back and she's ready to take down the competition with a Frenzy fueled rework.\nHer aggressive playstyle focuses around striking her opponent to build up Frenzy, and eviscerating them with a flurry of attacks.\nLaura's powerful Bleed Passives take things a step further when she taps into her instincts. Watch out!\n\n\nNEW FEATURES\n\n\nAlliance Coliseum\nIs your Alliance ready for a new kind of challenge? Enter The Coliseum and see how many health bars you can deplete from your opponent, then compare scores with your Alliance mates to work out which attackers are best suited for the fight. Match your Champion with the correct daily bonus tags and level up your Podiums in order to score as high as possible and take your Alliance to the top!\n\nNEW QUESTS AND EVENTS\n\n\nBanquet Event - Asgardian Gala\nNo matter which of the nine-realms you call home, it is time for merry-making and feasting! So warriors such as Jane Foster and Valkyrie invite one and all to make the most out of this celebration as they prepare for battle against the invading Eidols. FEAST on resources, CELEBRATE with Summoners, and make merry... while you can.\nFeaturing our annual anniversary celebrations, Accolades Event, New Years ‘Ring it in’ Arenas and Glorious Guardians, this Banquet Event is not one to be missed! Get your first opportunity to acquire newly 7-Star Champions such as  Absorbing Man, Valkyrie, Scorpion, Kingpin, Punisher, and Super-Skrull during this Event!\n\n\nEvent Quest - Lost And Found\nThe final Eidol, IMPERIOSA has arrived and with them comes no shortage of destruction and danger. Power is draining from ISO-8, foes are assembling, but possible friends are also revealing themselves. Will all the Eidols fall in line once the secrets of the Founders are revealed? Or will Imperiosa’s downfall be a result of Eidol handywork?\n\nSide Quest - Taken\nEidol invaders are taking over The Contest, and it has inspired The Collector into action. The Collector has a particular set of Skills (as well as Mutants, Sciences, and Techs). He had been attempting to take control over some Champions but 11 years of ISO-radiation and an ever-changing roster has perhaps left his skills of super-powered manipulation a little rusty. So now it’s up to The Summoner to break some violent brainwashing of a dozen Champions who have TAKEN a leave of their senses!\n\nAll this and more!

Damage from multiple attacks on a single troop within the same second will now be merged.\n- The avatars of defeated troops will now be fully grayed out.\n\n[Alliance]\n- To ensure interface clarity and standardize alliance names, rich text formatting in alliance names is no longer supported.\n- To improve readability, the Alliance Log has been split into two tabs: [War] and [Members].\n\n[Rankings]\nDue to varying progress across different states, cross-state Watchtower Level Rankings did not fairly reflect the upgrade progress of survivors in different states. Therefore:\n- The cross-state [Watchtower Level] Rankings have been removed.\n- Watchtower level information has been added to the cross-state [Personal CP Rankings].\n\n[MutaBeast Hunt]\n- Added 3 new difficulty levels: Crazy VIII, Crazy IX, and Crazy X.\n\n[Chat]\n- Added quick-action buttons when privately messaging non-friends: [Add to Blacklist] and [Add Friend].\n\n[Others]\n- Mail now only supports color changes in rich text; bold, italics, and font size changes are no longer supported.\n- When executing gathering-type events from the Radar, selecting [Apply gathering recommended lineup] will only adjust unit amount, not the hero lineup.\n- Starting from next term, you will receive a term-exclusive avatar frame and title upon becoming President.\n- Removed the time reference option from Settings. The time displayed on the Main Screen will now be unified to the time set in the Schedule.\n- In the [Shadow Calls] event, you can now filter the quality of tasks to perform from the top of the interface when initiating a Super Dispatch.\n- In the [Bio-Mutant] event, if the rally initiator's shelter is within 20 tiles of Frankenstein, the rally force's march time will be fixed at 3s.\n- Optimized the visual presentation of the [Survival Preparedness] event.\n- Improved the display effects of some buttons on the Main Screen.\n- Added a [Quick Exchange] function to the Survivor Market in [Season Celebration]. No confirmation pop-up will appear during exchange.\n- Added Exclusive Equipment Fragments for sale in the [Daily Sale] section of the Pack Shop\n- When there are unclaimed rewards for unlocking in the [Apocalypse Guide], opening the interface will automatically scroll to and highlight the earliest claimable reward.",
