To address this, we have increased the Oni King's HP (while keeping the difficulty unchanged) to ensure more survivors can participate in the event.\n\n[State of Supremacy]\nScore Adjustments for Escorting an S-tier Dark Syndicate Truck:\n- Before: Escort [an unplundered] / [a once-plundered] / [a twice-plundered] S-tier Dark Syndicate truck once: 500/200/100 points.\n- Now: After the update: Escort [an unplundered] / [a once-plundered] / [a twice-plundered] S-tier Dark Syndicate truck once: 125/50/25 points.\n- This adjustment takes effect starting next Monday, Nov 24.\n\n[Tyrant / Scorpion / Warfiend / Oni Spider]\n1. Adjusted the requirements for Personal Attack Count Rewards:\n- Before: Attack 1/3/5 times daily to claim rewards.\n- Now: Attack 1/2/4 times daily to claim rewards.\n2. Personal Attack Count Rewards can now be claimed from the event's main interface.\n3. Improved the real-time refresh speed of the Damage Rankings.\n\n[Others]\n1. Alliance R5/R4 can now cancel all types of Rally Troops.\n2. Streamlined the World main interface to expand combat operation space: Removed the left sidebar. Troop information is now permanently displayed in the lower right corner.\n- This is currently active in States 1-56, with others to follow.\n3. Chip Resonance Bonus Optimization: The [Faction Counter] at all bonus levels has been changed to [Troop DMG]. Survivors with active Resonance before this change will receive a CP boost after the update.\n- Before: Faction Counter +35%/70%/105%/140%/175%/210%/245%/280%/315%/350%/385%\n- Now: Troop DMG +10%/25%/35%/50%/60%/75%/85%/100%/110%/125%/135%\n4. Increased the number of members displayed in the Alliance member list for [Zombie Siege] and sorted them by reinforcement distance (nearest to farthest).\n5. Added the ability to view voting details of your Alliance members during the [Black Gold Battlefield] registration phase.\n6. Added a time display toggle in [Settings] - [General], allowing you to choose between [Local Time] and [Server Time].\n7. Improved the attack effects of the default march skin in the World.\n\n[Issue Fixes]\n- Fixed an issue where Dark Syndicate Truck escorts starting on Sunday but arriving on Monday were incorrectly counted toward the [State of Supremacy] event points.\n- Fixed inaccurate monster CP displays in [Dark Zone Ops] - [Derelict Mod Plant].",

The original [Mention] feature has been replaced by [Reply]. You can still mention a specific Survivor in chat by long-pressing their avatar.\n\n[Optimizations & Adjustments]\n\n[Sealed Island] Season\n- Lowered the recommended CP for Lv.1-65 [Rotting Onis] and [Booze Brutes].\n- Reduced the Viral Resistance of Lv.65+ [Blood Moon] Rotting Onis and [Blood Moon] Booze Brutes.\n- The Oni King's current HP is relatively low, causing it to be defeated before some Survivors could join the event. To address this, we have increased the Oni King's HP (while keeping the difficulty unchanged) to ensure more survivors can participate in the event.\n\n[State of Supremacy]\nScore Adjustments for Escorting an S-tier Dark Syndicate Truck:\n- Before: Escort [an unplundered] / [a once-plundered] / [a twice-plundered] S-tier Dark Syndicate truck once: 500/200/100 points.\n- Now: After the update: Escort [an unplundered] / [a once-plundered] / [a twice-plundered] S-tier Dark Syndicate truck once: 125/50/25 points.\n- This adjustment takes effect starting next Monday, Nov 24.\n\n[Tyrant / Scorpion / Warfiend / Oni Spider]\n1. Adjusted the requirements for Personal Attack Count Rewards:\n- Before: Attack 1/3/5 times daily to claim rewards.\n- Now: Attack 1/2/4 times daily to claim rewards.\n2. Personal Attack Count Rewards can now be claimed from the event's main interface.\n3. Improved the real-time refresh speed of the Damage Rankings.\n\n[Others]\n1. Alliance R5/R4 can now cancel all types of Rally Troops.\n2. Streamlined the World main interface to expand combat operation space: Removed the left sidebar. Troop information is now permanently displayed in the lower right corner.\n- This is currently active in States 1-56, with others to follow.\n3. Chip Resonance Bonus Optimization: The [Faction Counter] at all bonus levels has been changed to [Troop DMG]. Survivors with active Resonance before this change will receive a CP boost after the update.\n- Before: Faction Counter +35%/70%/105%/140%/175%/210%/245%/280%/315%/350%/385%\n- Now: Troop DMG +10%/25%/35%/50%/60%/75%/85%/100%/110%/125%/135%\n4. Increased the number of members displayed in the Alliance member list for [Zombie Siege] and sorted them by reinforcement distance (nearest to farthest).\n5. Added the ability to view voting details of your Alliance members during the [Black Gold Battlefield] registration phase.\n6. Added a time display toggle in [Settings] - [General], allowing you to choose between [Local Time] and [Server Time].\n7. Improved the attack effects of the default march skin in the World.\n\n[Issue Fixes]\n- Fixed an issue where Dark Syndicate Truck escorts starting on Sunday but arriving on Monday were incorrectly counted toward the [State of Supremacy] event points.\n- Fixed inaccurate monster CP displays in [Dark Zone Ops] - [Derelict Mod Plant].",
